Install
----
`git clone https://github.com/charles-l/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles` <br/>
`cd .dotfiles`

Choose what you want to install:
`stow bash`
`stow bin`
`stow i3`
`stow ... # etc, you get the point.`

`stow` is pretty freaking cool, and should be available in most distro's package databases.

Shell
----
Shell configuration is POSIX complient and will work in most shells. I personally prefer mksh ('cause it's lightweight and has many of the useful features of bash)
